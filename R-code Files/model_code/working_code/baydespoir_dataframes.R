# Import the data 

cruise <- read.csv("baydespoir_cruise.csv", header = T)
prof <- read.csv("baydespoir_prof.csv", header = T) # Has the most inforamtion on salinity
surf <- read.csv("baydespoir_surf.csv", header = T)

# Looking for patterns within the salinity data 
plot(prof$OBS_MONTH, prof$PSAL) # Pretty even, some drops in salinity around 10 (October)
plot(prof$OBS_YEAR, prof$PSAL) # Data isn;t taken every year and has some gaps. Lower salinity
# levels taken ~1997
plot(prof$OBS_TIME, prof$PSAL) # Missing a lot of inforamtion before 10 am. After this, the data
# becomes a more homogenous

# Seeing if there is a pattern with when the observation was taken (time in 24H)
plot(prof$OBS_YEAR, prof$OBS_TIME) 
plot(prof$OBS_MONTH, prof$OBS_TIME)


# Subset data; focus from 10 am on forward 
prof_subset <- subset(prof, PSAL >0 & OBS_TIME > 1000, select= OBS_YEAR:PSAL) # Removing all

plot(prof_subset$OBS_MONTH, prof_subset$PSAL)

hist(prof_subset$OBS_MONTH)  # Not equal distrubution of observations across months 
hist(prof_subset$OBS_YEAR)   # 90% of the data comes from 1996

# Looks like most of the data is comig from 1997. I thused subset the data to only contain 1997. The following
# plots aim to look at the distrubution of the data. 

prof_1997 <- subset(prof, OBS_YEAR == 1997, select=OBS_MONTH:PSAL)
hist(prof_1997$PSAL) # Most of the data is between 30:35 PSU 
hist(prof_1997$OBS_MONTH) # Data is only recorded at four months 

#Looking at how the mean, mode, and medium change between the raw data and the subset

mean(prof$PSAL, na.rm = T) # 32.02758
mean(prof_1997$PSAL, na.rm = T) # 31.80257

median(prof$PSAL, na.rm = T) # 32.177
median(prof_1997$PSAL, na.rm = T) # 32.117

# There is little change between the raw and subet data, likely due to large weight of the data at the upper 
# tail.
